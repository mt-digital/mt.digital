            Hello and welcome! Below you will find a little more about my 
            past, current, and future projects, and learn
            how I could assist you with problems you face in understanding
           and predicting human social behavior.

            Extremism and polarization research
        </h2>
        <p class="col-md-12">
            My research focuses on understanding the causes and effects of extremism and polarization, especially related to mass communication strategies, and communication-independent cognitive and social factors such as the human tendency to conform, especially when influenced by other people and facts that one already knows. I will begin a postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford University in September 2021 to expand and continue this work.

            Consulting services
        </h2>
        <p class="col-md-12">
            I am also available for consulting, with two primary services. I offer services to help businesses and other organizations understand extremism and polarization among employees and members. I also provide services for developing and implementing computational solutions for problems regarding other social outcomes in business and society, including problems amenable to agent-based modeling. Please do not hesitate to 
            <a href="mailto:matt@abm.consulting">contact me</a> to 
            tell me about your work and interests or tell me about 
            problems you face in understanding and predicting the 
            behavior of people in social environments.

            More about me
        </h2>
        <p class="col-md-12">
            Before starting to contribute to our understanding of extremism, polarization, and other social phenomena, I worked on several diverse, computationally intensive problems. I developed novel imaging systems, new forecasting methodologies for economic data, and cyberinfrastructure for integrated hydrological science in the intermountain West of the United States. Most recently, I was a professional software developer, working first as a data engineer at Economic Modeling Specialists, Int’l, then as a research software developer at the Northwest Knowledge Network at the University of Idaho. Before that I obtained a master’s in applied physics (with thesis) at Rice University in Houston, TX after obtaining undergraduate degrees in mathematics and physics at Syracuse University in Syracuse, NY.
        </p>
        <p class="col-md-12">
            It is undoubtedly important to develop deep, vertical expertise in one subject to significantly contribute to research literature on important subjects. I find it equally important, rewarding, and fun to expand horizontally to contribute to diverse scientific and engineering problems that require multi-disciplinary, multi-method approaches.
