            I'm currently a <a href="http://graduatestudents.ucmerced.edu/mturner8">
            graduate student in the Cognitive and Information
            Sciences at UC Merced</a>. It's great here.
            The city of Merced isn't the sort of place that's in
            fashion these days, but maybe that's a good thing.

            This page will come to feature technique posts, essays, and
            white papers of mine. No exact theme yet. As of 9/18/16 I have begun
            adding older material from other blogs/pages I've created
            over the years.

        <p>
            I'm building a corpus of political discourse that will first
            include the 2012 and 2016 debates and associated news coverage
            accessed from the
            <a href="http://archive.org/details/tv">TV News Archive</a>. These
            are some notes on tools I can and likely will use to do that
            and ideas for a prototype web app, or "corpus plus".

            Searle argued that only machines could be conscious, by which he
            meant that there is no mental stuff that is conscious. How might
            consciousness be measured? Tononi and co-workers provide a
            potential means to measure consciousness in natural or engineered
            systems. Based on a prompt by

        <p>
            Some time ago I copied a vinyl record of a speech given by
            Nobel laureate George Wald in protest of the Vietnam war and
            the weaponization of academic achievements. He describes
            his observations
            of a pervasive feeling of loss and hopelessness among his students,
            pointing out that "a lecture is more of a conversation" than most
            people realize. This is a radio show I made to explore the key
            points from the speech. There are two other related posts
            preceding this one on my
            <a href="http://mtpain.github.io">old blog at mtpain.github.io</a>.

            Some ranty, incoherently angry (hangry?) blog posts I wrote as my
            time at Rice University as a grad student in applied physics was
            coming to an end. I had been participating in some protest
            events in Houston, presenting my work to investors from the CIA,
            and struggling to understand how to balance my love for my
            country and patriotism with the feeling that we as a country don't
            always do the right thing.
