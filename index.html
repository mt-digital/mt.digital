                    Hello and welcome! I am currently a postdoctoral researcher
                    at Stanford University studying the evolution of social learning
                    in uncertain environments, advised by James Holland Jones
                    in the Department of Earth System Science.
                </p>
                <p class="col-md-12">
                    Prior to this postdoctoral work I obtained my PhD from 
                    the University of California, Merced, advised by Paul
                    Smaldino in the Cognitive and Information Sciences program.
                    Before receiving my PhD, I worked professionally
                    as a data engineer and research software developer after
                    receiving a MS in applied physics from Rice University and
                    a dual BS in mathematics and physics from Syracuse University.

                <p class="col-md-12">
                    I love to use computational
                    modeling to develop and test
                    theories of social behavior, and to solve difficult 
                    practical problems. 
                    If you have a problem you think could
                    be addressed through computational modeling, please consider

            How social structure emerges from cognition and social influence
        </h2>
        <p class="col-md-12">
            How and why do social structures, such as extremism and polarization, 
            emerge? What about population-level tendencies, 
            such as how frequently individuals base their decisions
            on what others are doing, instead of relying on their own personal
            experience? Why is there a "replication crisis" and other cracks in the 
            foundations of psychological and other science? These questions
            motivate my research.
        </p>
        <p class="col-md-12">
            In focusing on extremism and polarization, I have identified a 
            number of root cognitive factors that lead to rising extremism and 
            polarization, including initial extremism, communication
            noise, and random chance (<a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2018/2740959/">"Paths to Polarization", <i>Complexity</i>, 2018</a>). It seems
            that the empirical fact that extremists are more stubborn leads to
            rising extremism as social influence progresses, but empirical 
            studies may need improved statistical methods to properly measure
            this (<a href="https://cognitivesciencesociety.org/cogsci20/papers/0153/index.html">"Stubborn extremism as a potential pathway to group polarization", 
            <i>42nd Annual Cog. Sci. Conference</i>, 2020</a>; follow-up journal
        articles in preparation). My work benefits from clear thinking about what
            models are and how we learn from them (<a href="">"Mechanistic modeling for the 
            masses", Comment on forthcoming Yarkoni, "The Genearlizability Crisis", 
            in <i>Behavioral and Brain Sciences</i></a>).

        </p>
        <p class="col-md-12">
            More recently I have begun studying the fundamental cognitive,
            social, and evolutionary processes and factors 
            that determine how frequently
            people learn from others. This work will be presented as a conference
            talk at the American Association of Biological Anthropologists in
            March, 2022, and will be presented in the form of conference and journal
            articles in the coming months.

    <!--         Before starting to contribute to our understanding of extremism, polarization, and other social phenomena, I worked on several diverse, computationally intensive problems. I have developed novel imaging systems, new forecasting methodologies for economic data, and cyberinfrastructure for integrated hydrological science in the intermountain West of the United States. Immediately before beginning my PhD work I was as a software developer working first as a data engineer at Economic Modeling Specialists, Int’l, then as a research software developer at the Northwest Knowledge Network at the University of Idaho. Before that I obtained a master’s in applied physics (with thesis) at Rice University in Houston, TX after obtaining undergraduate degrees in mathematics and physics at Syracuse University in Syracuse, NY. -->
